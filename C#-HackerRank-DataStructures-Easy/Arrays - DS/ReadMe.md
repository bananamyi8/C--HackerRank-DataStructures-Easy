Create an empty list called reversed to store elements in reverse order.

Loop through the input list a starting from the last element (index a.Count - 1) down to the first element (index 0).

For each element in this reverse iteration, add (append) the element to the reversed list.

After the loop completes, return the reversed list containing all elements of a but in reversed order.

This algorithm effectively constructs a new reversed list by iterating backward through the original list and copying elements one by one.

Characteristics
Time Complexity: 
O
(
n
)
O(n), where 
n
n is the number of elements in the list. Each element is visited once in the loop.

Space Complexity: 
O
(
n
)
O(n) due to creating a new list to store the reversed elements.
